Private! No Peeking!
Password Generator Project


This is the third Challenge in Coding Bootcamp.
After being introduced to JavaScript we were tasked with creating a password generator.
We were given starter code in a js file along with a html and css file.
The acceptance criteria simplified:
    Creating a prompt for the length of the password and setting those parameters between 8 and 128 characters.
    And individual prompts for the options of including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
    after all input is validated and password is generated!
